Steps to increase a data disk.

 

Note: Backup data before you perform below actions

 

$vmname="vpn000"

$servicename="vpn000"

 

1.       Get data disk name

 

#OS disk

Get-AzureVM -ServiceName$servicename -Name $vmname | Get-azureosDisk

 

#Data disk

Get-AzureVM -ServiceName$servicename -Name $vmname | Get-azuredataDisk

 

 

HostCaching         : None

DiskLabel           : ResizeDisk

DiskName            : vpn000-vpn000-0-201512100417240077 <------------------Get Disk Name

Lun                 : 0

LogicalDiskSizeInGB : 50

MediaLink           :https://portalvhdskpqv2xx70nrh6.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/vpn000-vpn000-1210-1.vhd

SourceMediaLink     :

IOType              : Standard

ExtensionData       :

 

 

 

 

$diskname="vpn000-vpn000-0-201512100417240077"

$size="50"

 

2.       Stop deallocate the VM

#OS disk

we have to shut down VM in the portal

 

Get-AzureVM  -ServiceName$servicename -Name $vmname  | Stop-AzureVM -Force

 

#Data disk

1. We could shut down VM as OS disk.

2. We could only detach data disk from VM without VM reboot.

 

 

3.       Expand the disk size

 

Update-AzureDisk -Label ResizeDisk -DiskName $diskname  -ResizedSizeInGB$size

 

 

4.       Start Azure VM

 

#OS disk

Get-AzureVM -ServiceName $servicename  -Name $vmname| Start-AzureVM

 

#Data disk

1. Start Azure VM

2. Re-Attach VHD

 

5.       Extend disk in OS

Windows VM

RDP TO VM> OPEN DISK MANAGEMENT>RIGHT CLICK C DRIVE>EXTEND OPTION> EXTEND TO TARGET SIZE 50 GB



 

Linux VM

1. Once the PowerShell commands complete cleanly restart the VM

SSH into the VM and check the data disk device has increased.

 

dmesg |grep -i sdc

 

[sdc] 1048576000 512-byte logical blocks: (536 GB/500 GiB)

 

2. Run sudo fdisk /dev/sdc

•use p to list the partitions. Make note of the start cylinder of /dev/sdc1

•use d to delete first the swap partition (2) and then the /dev/sdc1 partition. This is very scary but is actually harmless as the data is not written to the disk until you write the changes to the disk.

•use n to create a new primary partition. Make sure its start cylinder is exactly the same as the old /dev/sdc1 used to have. For the end cylinder agree with the default choice, which is to make the partition to span the whole disk.

(use a to toggle the bootable flag on any bootable device)

•review your changes, make a deep breath and use w to write the new partition table to disk. You'll get a message telling that the kernel couldn't re-read the partition table because the device is busy, but that's ok.

 

3. Reboot with sudo reboot. When the system boots, you'll have a smaller filesystem living inside a larger partition.

 

4. Run sudo resize2fs /dev/sdc1 - this form will default to making the filesystem to take all available space on the partition.
